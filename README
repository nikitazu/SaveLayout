SaveLayout
==========

Keyboard layout manager. Switches keyboard layout automagically
based on which application is frontmost on your desktop.


Usage
-----

Just start it and hide in dock.


Behaviour
---------

When you press CMD+SPACE to switch keboard layout,
SaveLaoyt saves your input source for current application.

When you switch to other application, it looks up saved
input source and loads it. If nothing is previously saved
then it switches to default input source.


TODO
----

If you change decrease the number of input sources it may
break switching to saved application.

If you change input sources not with CMD+SPACE your 
change will go unnoticed by SaveLayout, and when you 
switch out fo it and then back it will restore previous layout.
